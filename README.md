### Hi there <img src="https://github.com/TheDudeThatCode/TheDudeThatCode/blob/master/Assets/Hi.gif" width="29px">

I am a proficient Software Engineer and an adept technical writer. I strongly belive that open source is a way of giving back to contributors and communities which is why I constantly look for ways to contribute meaningfully to Open Source codes, documentations, and communities.
